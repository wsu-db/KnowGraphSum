# GraphSum
Code for graph summarization project (Mining Summaries for Knowledge Graph Search. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (**ICDM**), 2016.
Qi Song, Yinghui Wu, Luna Xin Dong)

Algorithm:

For anytime algorithm please check NewSPMine

For view selection algorithm please check PatternSelection.

We also put a basic version of VF2 there.

Dataset:

Yago,DBPedia, Freebase and sysnthetic dataset are all avaliable in corresponding website. As we implement our algorithms on Neo4j, you can try this RDF importer: https://github.com/mybyte/tools/tree/master/Turtle%20loader


Note: this implementation is based on Neo4j2.3.0, as Neo4j do not support this version anymore, I'll publish another version of this summarization project without neo4j soon'
